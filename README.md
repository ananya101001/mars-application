# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Name: Annaya Praveen Shetty
Task: Create a Multi-Stage Mars Visit Application Form

Technology stack used to build the Application :

Frontend:
**React**: React uses a virtual DOM, which is an in-memory representation of the real DOM. When the state of an app changes, React first updates the virtual DOM and then efficiently updates only the parts of the actual DOM that need to change, making React fast and responsive.

**Vite**: I choosed Vite because its modern, fast, and developer-friendly features, which offer several benefits, especially when working with modern JavaScript frameworks like React.

**JSX**: JavaScript syntax extension used by React to write HTML elements inside JavaScript.

**Formik**: A popular library for building forms in React, helping with form handling and validation.
**Yup**: A JavaScript schema builder for runtime validation, used in combination with Formik for form validation.

Version Control:
**Git**: A distributed version control system to track changes in your code.
(master branch)


Deployment:
**GitHub Pages**: A static site hosting service that serves Mars Visit Application form application from a GitHub repository.
gh-pages: A Node.js package to simplify deployment to GitHub Pages particular when we use JSX.
